# exchange-ratecheck
simple shellscript for checking exchange rate.

you can:

-Change "EUR-BRL" in the response and "EURBRL" in the bid and pct fields to check other currencies.

-Adjust the level of precison by changim "%.2f"

I'm using the xfce4-genmon-plugin  to check the rate at regular intervals, but you can use this script in other ways too.
